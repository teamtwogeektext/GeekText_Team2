            'For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. 
            Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into 
            the future—a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. 
            To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire—both 
            scientists and scholars—and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve 
            as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation.
            But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the 
            wake of the receding Empire. And mankind’s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: 
            submit to the barbarians and live as slaves—or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction.'),

            'This account of a group of barnyard animals who revolt against their vicious human master, 
            only to submit to a tyranny erected by their own kind, is a universal drama. Taking as his 
            starting point the betrayed promise of the Russian Revolution, Orwell lays out a vision that, 
            in its bitter wisdom, gives us the clearest understanding we possess of the possible consequences
            of our social and political acts. Orwell is one of the very few modern satirists comparable to 
            Jonathan Swift in power, artistry, and moral authority; in Animal Farm his spare prose and the 
            logic of his dark comedy brilliantly highlight his stark message.'),
